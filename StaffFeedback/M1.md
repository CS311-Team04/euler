# SwEnt M1 Team Grading Report

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

## Implementation (APK, CI, tests)

We looked at whether your APK is functional and reliable. We also assessed your repo setup, whether it is clearly organized and if there is a CI running Sonar Cloud and running tests including at least one meaningful end-to-end test.

No CI generated APK
- There is no meaningful end-to-end test
The teams has defined basic rules in the wiki and they try to follow them which is a good starting point. The team also shows partial awareness of process expectations. However the timeline of some Issues are inconsistent (marked as done when they aren't and some a lot are closed without reason), The Scrum Board isn't yet properly set up (some issues are missing their respective branchs and tags). Wiki needs a home page and also needs to contain the links to the individual retrospectives.

For this part, you received 2.4 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them.
We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

There was no sprint 3 backlog

Your user story aren't assigned to Sprints, and aren't moved through the scrum board as they are completed

For this part, you received 2.25 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma

We evaluated your Figma, whether it is up-to-date with the app and how it is used as a communication, planning and design tool to accelerate the implementation of good UI.

The figma is up to date with your app and is being used to experiments the UI.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Architecture

We reviewed your projectâ€™s architecture diagram, whether it is up-to-date with the app and if it follows clean design principles. We also looked at how it is used to discuss and document the architecture of the app as the app evolves.

Great first draft of the architecture diagram, but some dependency on the domain layer aren't explicit. For example how does the setting impact the LLM / Chat ?

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process Documents

We reviewed your Scrum process documentation, including Sprint Retrospectives and Team Standup. We assessed whether they documented the process in detail, and how they were used to prepare the meetings. We also looked at your ability to lead structured and effective meetings, with everyone's participation.

No stand up documents found

Members are often late or absents, and lack some engagement

For this part, you received 3 points out of a maximum of 6.
